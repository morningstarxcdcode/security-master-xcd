    The VulnerabilityScanner is like a vigilant guard for your codebase.
    Its main job is to look for known weaknesses or "vulnerabilities"
    that could be exploited by malicious actors.

    In a real-world scenario, this class would orchestrate calls to various
    specialized security tools (like SAST, DAST, or dependency scanners).
    For our current demonstration, it simulates finding a common issue.
