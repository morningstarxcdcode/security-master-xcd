class FixSuggester:
    """
    The FixSuggester acts like a helpful assistant, offering concrete advice
    on how to mend detected security issues. It aims to provide actionable
    code snippets or clear instructions to resolve vulnerabilities.

    In a more advanced system, this could involve:
    - Analyzing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the code.
    - Consulting a database of common fixes for specific vulnerability types.
    - Even generating code patches automatically.

        Initializes the fix suggester with its configuration.
