# Usage Guide for `security-master-xcd`

Welcome to `security-master-xcd`! This guide will help you get started with the security automation toolkit, understand its typical workflow, and show you how to contribute.

## Quick Start

To get `security-master-xcd` up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/morningstarxcdcode/security-master-xcd.git
cd security-master-xcd
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_scan.py --config=config/sample.yaml
```

This will clone the repository, install the necessary Python dependencies, and run a security scan using the provided sample configuration.

## Typical Workflow

`security-master-xcd` is designed to streamline your security analysis and remediation process. Here's how a typical workflow looks:

```
[Codebase] --> [Scanner] --> [Detected Issues]
    |
    v
[Issue Reporter] --> [Human-Readable Alerts]
    |
    v
[Fix Suggester] --(if auto-fix enabled)--> [Suggested Fixes]
    |
    v
[PR Creator] --(if auto-PR enabled)--> [Automatic Pull Request]
    |
    v
[Manual Guidance] --(if auto-fix not possible)--> [Actionable Links]
```

1.  **Run the scanner**: Execute `python run_scan.py --config=your_config.yaml` (or `config/sample.yaml` for a quick test). The tool will scan your codebase and output vulnerability alerts directly to your console. Each alert will include *precise locations* (file and line number) where the issue was detected.

2.  **Review alerts**: Pay attention to the *short title* at the head of each alert. This provides a quick summary of the detected vulnerability. Detailed information, including severity and status, will also be presented.

3.  **Auto-fix or Manual Guidance**: If enabled in your configuration, the tool may provide *automated fix suggestions* for certain issues. You can choose to accept these suggestions. For issues that cannot be automatically resolved, `security-master-xcd` will provide *manual fix guidance*, including actionable links to advisories and clear next steps.

4.  **Auto-PR**: For issues with automated fixes, if configured, the tool can *automatically open pull requests* with the suggested patches. This significantly reduces the manual effort required for remediation.
