class PRCreator:
    """
    The PRCreator is like a diligent scribe and messenger for your code repository.
    Its purpose is to automatically prepare and propose changes (in the form of
    Pull Requests or Merge Requests) to fix detected vulnerabilities.

    In a real-world application, this component would interact with version
    control systems (like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) via their APIs to:
    1. Create a new branch.
    2. Apply the suggested code changes to that branch.
    3. Commit the changes with a clear, descriptive message.
    4. Open a new Pull Request, linking back to the vulnerability report.
    """
    def __init__(self, config):
        """
        Initializes the PR creator with configuration settings.
        This configuration typically includes details needed to interact with
        the version control system, such as API tokens, repository names,
        and the target branch for new pull requests.

            fix_suggestion (dict): A dictionary containing the details of the

        # 5. Commit these changes with a message like "Fix: Hash Flooding Vulnerability (HSEC-2023-0001)".
        # 6. Open a new Pull Request from the new branch to the target branch (e.g., 'main').
