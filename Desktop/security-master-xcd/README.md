# security-master-xcd

**security-master-xcd** is a security automation toolkit designed to elevate codebase protection with a *human-first touch*. Our mission is to provide a straightforward, accessible, and comprehensive solution for detecting and remediating security vulnerabilities.

## Features

-   **Automatic Pull Requests**: Scans for vulnerabilities and automatically opens PRs with recommended changes.
-   **Automated Fix Suggestions**: Provides inline code snippet proposals based on detected issues.
-   **Precise Issue Locations**: Generates reports with the exact line and file corresponding to the root of the problem.
-   **Vulnerability Detection and Reporting**: Summarizes advisories with clear, concise alerts.
-   **Relative Path Management**: Ensures all file paths in reports are relative to the project root.
-   **Issue Body Rework**: Redesigns output issue/report bodies for clarity, splitting information into sections (Summary, Affected Components, Steps to Fix).
-   **Integration with GitHub Actions**: Implements scanning and alert creation as a GitHub Action workflow.
-   **Manual Fix Guidance**: Auto-inserts actionable links (advisory URLs) and summarizes next steps when automation cannot resolve a problem.
-   **Extensible Architecture**: Designed for easy plugin of new vulnerability scanners, issue formatters, and reporting pipelines.
